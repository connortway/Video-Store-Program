# Video Store Program
This project was done for a data structures and algorithms class. The guidlines were to develop a program that a small video store would use.
It stores customers(name, phone number, movies owned, and number of movies owned) in a binary tree.
It also stores movies(title, barcode, owner, avaliablility) in a binary tree. 
You can add movies or customers, search for movies or customers, rent movies to customers and return movies. A customer can only have 3 movies rented at a time.
